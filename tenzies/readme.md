Made a game called tenzies where you have to keep rolling dice until you hit 10 of the same number. To play click on a dice to freeze and then click the roll button to get a new set of dice. Keep rolling until all 10 dice are frozen with the same number. 

This project helped me learn the React hooks useState and useEffect. I had to check if 10 of the same dice were frozen on each roll using useEffect on two state variables that stored information about the dice and information on whether the user had won respectively.
